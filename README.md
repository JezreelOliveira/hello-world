# hello-world
First repository created by me in all my life.
Hi everybody. My name is Jezreel Oliveira and I'm a brazilian. I have a mechanical engineering degree and now I'm trying to learn how to code and work in this area. I'll try to learn english while studying software engineering too.
My target is start from zero and fing a job in 6 months, studying by my self. I know, it's a huge challenge (learn to be self-taugh, how to code and be fluent in english), but I'll give me a try.
